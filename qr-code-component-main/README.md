## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since this is the first project that I've done, I learned the basics of using git and Github, as well as how to host a website on Netlify. This challenge was a good opportunity to learn how to set up a project. I also had the chance to practice CSS a little bit and use Flexbox.


### Continued development

I need the see what are best practices for coming up with names for classes in my HTML before my next project. I also need to learn how the 'box-shadow' property works.
