## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since this is the first project that I've done, I learned the basics of using git and Github, as well as how to host a website on Netlify.
I also learned how to use 'rem' instead of 'px' by setting the setting the font-value on the ':root' element to 62.5%.
Another good thing I learned is how to remove the white space below images. Images are inline-level elements and the browser leaves extra white space below them. To remove it, we just have to set the 'display' value of the image to 'block'.


### Continued development

Before starting my next project I need to do the following:
  -Look up best practices for coming up with names for classes in my HTML;
  -Learn how the 'box-shadow' property works;
  -Read about the HTML 'role' attribute;

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Px, em or rem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11799236/should-i-use-px-or-rem-value-units-in-my-css) - This helped me see how to use 'rem' units instead of 'px'.
- [Tutorial Republic - How to remove the extra white space underneath an image using CSS](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-remove-white-space-under-an-image-using-css.php) - This helped me see how to remove the white space that the browser leaves below images.
